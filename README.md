# Mentor Dashboard View

This project is a Mentor Dashboard View built using the MERN stack. It allows mentors to evaluate students by assigning marks and generating evaluation reports.

## Features

- **Student Selection**: On the first page, mentors can see a list of student names and select a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 4 students at a time.
- **Evaluation Page**: After selecting students, mentors can proceed to the evaluation page where the selected students' names and roll numbers are displayed. Here, mentors can assign marks to each student (less than 10).
- **Reselect Option**: Mentors have the option to reselect students, which takes them back to the first page.
- **Submit Marks**: Mentors can submit the marks, which will be updated in the database. The evaluation status for each student will be marked as done.
- **Evaluation Report**: After evaluating all students, there is a submit button that generates a report in DOCX format. Additionally, a notification email is sent to inform stakeholders that the evaluation is uploaded.
